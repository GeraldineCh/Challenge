# Tecnhical Challenge

## Used tools

- iTunes resources
- PostMan App
- Brackets

## Requirements

  1. Technical 
  - [ ] the list should display up to 200 Taylor Swift songs read from the API. 
  - [x] The list should include the trackName, collectionName, and trackId from the API.
  - [x] the list should contain no duplicate songs. If two or more songs have exactly the same title, only one should be shown.
  - [x] the list should be scrollable.
  - [x] the list should display an image from the API associated with the song.
  - [x] the page should load fast.
   
   2. Design
  - [x] each song in the list should change color to gray on mouseover
  - [x] the list of songs section should scroll vertically to allow the user to see the entire list.
  - [ ] the title bar at top should stay in place and be visible on the screen even when the list scrolls.
  - [x] the section at right (“other charts”) should not scroll. This content should be displayed as written.
  
   3. Final question: is there anything else that is needed before this can be deployed to production?
      Actually, yes. When I started to read the challenge, with the iTunes documentation and the PostMan App, I realized that the items under the tag of Taylor Swift were only 50. But one of the points speaks about 200 songs, so it confuses me a little and I believe that a fluent communication with the technical support it will be great in these cases.
      Also, it seems a desktop mockup but maybe we must also have a mobile version of it. 
      Before deploy, the client must give the final impressions because the minute this product go online, it must be in the constant upgrade in the idea of giving a better experience to the final costumers.
